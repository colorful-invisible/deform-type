![Deform Type Screenshot](sketch_1.png)

A generative art project built with p5.js that allows you to interactively deform text on a grid by dragging handles.

## Description

This project creates a dynamic text display where letters are arranged in a grid. You can deform the text by dragging the circular handles at the intersections of the grid lines. The text can be customized through settings, and you can toggle between light and dark themes.

## Usage

- **Drag handles**: Click and drag the pulsing circular handles to deform the text grid.
- **Toggle theme**: Press `H` to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Save snapshot**: Press `S` to save a high-resolution PNG image of the current deformation.

## Customization

You can modify the text, font size, number of columns, and font family through the settings panel (if available in your setup).
